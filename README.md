This does not yet have the script to make the training data. <br>

<br>
Before using the scripts make the following folders:
```bash
mkdir images-for-prediction
mkdir model-weights-and training-history
mkdir training-data
mkdir training-data/images
mkdir training-data/patches
mkdir training-data/test
mkdir training-data/test/images
mkdir training-data/test/patches
```
